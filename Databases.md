# Intro to databases

## What is a database?

A database is a collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, storage, and modification. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of data, and they are essential for many applications, including web applications, enterprise systems, and data analysis.

## Types of databases

There are several types of databases, including:

1. Relational databases: These databases use a structured query language (SQL) to store and retrieve data in a tabular format.
2. NoSQL databases: These databases use a variety of data models, including key-value pairs, document-oriented, and graph-based models.
3. Object-oriented databases: These databases store data in objects, which can be used to represent real-world entities.
4. In-memory databases: These databases store data in memory, which allows for fast access and modification.
5. Distributed databases: These databases store data across multiple servers, which allows for scalability and fault tolerance.
6. Graph databases: These databases store data in a graph format, which allows for efficient traversal of relationships between data points.
7. Vector databases: These databases store data in a vector format, which allows for efficient retrieval of similar data points. Used in AI applications, recommend systems, etc.

## SQL vs NoSQL

### SQL (Structured Query Language)

SQL is a standardized language used to manage relational databases. It is used to create, modify, and query databases, as well as to define relationships between tables. SQL is a declarative language, which means that it describes the desired result without specifying how to achieve it. The schemas are very hard to change and are very strict. These databases store data in the form of rows and columns.

### NoSQL (Not only SQL)

NoSQL is a type of database that does not use SQL. Instead, it uses a variety of data models, including key-value pairs, document-oriented, and graph-based models. NoSQL databases are often used for unstructured data, such as social media data, sensor data, and clickstream data. NoSQL is a schemaless database, the data is not stored in a fixed schema. Faster to develop and faster to scale. These databases store data in the form of documents.
